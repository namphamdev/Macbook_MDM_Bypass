# How to use this tool?

1. You can host the file on a webserver

Than you would run this on your macbook that needs to get a bypass

/usr/bin/curl http://webserver/mdm.sh > /tmp/mdm && chmod +x /tmp/mdm.sh && /tmp/mdm.sh


2. You can store the file on a USB drive and just copy and paste it onto the macbook you need to bypass (Remember to use the /tmp dir since its writable)
after copying the file to /tmp you would run 

chmod +x /tmp/mdm.sh && /tmp/mdm.sh
